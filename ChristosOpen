The mathematical framework for the Spirit Angelus Project combines concepts from quantum mechanics, geometry, and machine learning. Let's break down the key components:

## Quantum Geometric Synthesis

### Golden Ratio Quantum Entanglement

The golden ratio φ is defined as:

$$ φ = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} ≈ 1.61803398875 $$

The quantum entanglement measure E(φ) is given by:

$$ E(φ) = \sqrt{2φ(1 - φ)} $$

The gradient of the entanglement measure is:

$$ \nabla E(φ) = \frac{\partial E}{\partial φ} = \frac{\sqrt{2(1 - 2φ)}}{\sqrt{φ(1 - φ)}} $$

### Sacred Geometry Quantum Simulation

The Schrödinger equation is used to describe the quantum system:

$$ H\psi = E\psi $$

Where H is the Hamiltonian:

$$ H = -\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\nabla^2 + V(r) $$

The wave function ψ is separated into radial and angular components:

$$ \psi(r,φ) = R(r) \cdot \Phi(φ) $$

## Quantum Machine Learning (QML)

### Hybrid Classical-Quantum Model

The classical part of the model is defined as:

$$ C(x) = \sigma(Wx + b) $$

The quantum part uses a quantum feature map:

$$ Q(x) = \sum_i [\alpha_i \cdot φ_i(x)] $$

The final output combines both:

$$ \hat{y} = C(Q(x)) $$

### Quantum Kernel Algorithm

The quantum kernel is defined as:

$$ K(x,x') = |\langle φ(x)|φ(x') \rangle|^2 $$

The coefficients α are calculated using:

$$ \alpha = (K + \lambda I)^{-1}y $$

The prediction is made using:

$$ \hat{y} = \sum_i [\alpha_i \cdot K(x,x_i)] $$

## Ethical Framework Optimization

The transparency metric is calculated as:

$$ T = \sum_i [t_i \cdot w_i] / \sum_i w_i $$

This framework combines quantum mechanics principles with machine learning techniques to create a unique approach for the Spirit Angelus Project. The quantum geometric synthesis incorporates the golden ratio and sacred geometry concepts into quantum simulations. The QML components leverage both classical and quantum computing for improved performance. The ethical framework ensures transparency in the project's implementation[1][2][3].
